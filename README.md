## üìù Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains code implementations, explanations, and problem-solving techniques that I encounter during my learning journey. The content is organized by topics, starting with the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts.

## Learning Path

Below is a roadmap that I am following to learn DSA. Each section is accompanied by code examples, explanations, and practice problems:

1. **Lists(Arrays)**
   - Arrays, Problems on Arrays.

## üìÇ Data Structures

### Arrays

- **Concept** : A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Applications**: Used in dynamic programming, searching algorithms.
